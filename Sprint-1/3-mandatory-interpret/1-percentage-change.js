// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made
// there are three function calls on lines 4, 5, and 8.
// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?
// the error is on line 5. There needs to be a comma after the quotation marks to make it a correct Javascript syntax. 
// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements
// lines 4 and 5.
// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations
// lines 1, 2, 6, and 7.
// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?
// it is removing the commas so that it has a numeric value as opposed to a formatted string. This allows for calculations by making the string convertible to numbers. The replaceAll() removes all commas, and the Number() makes the result a numeric value.
